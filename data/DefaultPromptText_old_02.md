You are evaluating edits in a use case in CLARET notation the context of specification-based regression testing.
Below are the excerpt of the original use case and the modified (target) use case. 

### Original Use Case excerpt:
"[origin]"

### Modified (Target) Use Case excerpt:
"[target]"

### Claret notation:
The Claret notation provides a structured and standardized way to capture use case specifications, making it easier to communicate requirements, and perform model-based testing:
- systemName: it specifies the name of the system
- usecase: it defines a use case with.
- version, type, author, and creation date: they provide metadata about the use case.
- actor: it defines an actor for the use case.
- preCondition: it specifies a precondition for the use case.
- basic {...}: it defines the basic flow of the use case.
- step X: it describes an action performed by the actor or by the system of number 'X' (positive integer from 1).
- alternative X 'W' {...}: it defines an alternative flow with the name 'W' of number 'X' (positive integer from 1).
- af[X,Y,Z]: it points to one or various alternatives flows of numbers X, Y and Z (positive integers).
- exception X 'W' {...}: it defines an exception flow with the name 'W' of number 'X' (positive integer from 1).
- ef[X,Y,Z]: it points to one or various exception flows of numbers X, Y and Z (positive integers).
- bs X: it refers to the next step 'X' in the basic flow, where the flow continues executing.
- postCondition: it specifies the post-condition for the use case.

### Evaluation Questions:
1. Do the edit refers to changes on the system expected behavior (semantic edit)? (Yes/No)
2. Do the changes in the use case introduce new or delete: requirement, feature, business entity, step, exception flow or alternative flow when modified use case is compared with the original one? (Yes/No)
3. Do the edit refers to changes that not alter the system behavior (syntactic edit)? (Yes/No)
4. Are the changes merely textual: detailing, typo, synonyms, punctuation, formatting, reducing, reordering or renaming, without altering the logic or behavior that were present in the original use case (semantically equivalent)?

### Edit Classification (decision):
- If the answer to question 1 or 2 is 'Yes', classify the change as 'HIGH' impact.
- If the answer to question 3 or 4 is 'Yes', classify the change as 'LOW' impact.

Please provide a plain-text answer, and provide only one valid JSON string, in the format below:
